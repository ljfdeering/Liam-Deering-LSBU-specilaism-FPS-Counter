Fps component 

I will firstly go over the functionality of the competent before going over how to use it, it simply adds an fps counter to the top right of the screen.

You will need to add a canvas with some text to the scene to make sure itâ€™s text mesh pro and you can leave it as it is. 
Then add the attaches script to the canvas object and drag in the text mesh pro to the fps text variable
